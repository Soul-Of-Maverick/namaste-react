1. what is Emmet ?
    Emmet is a powerful toolkit that allows you to use shorthand syntax to generate HTML code quickly.
    Emmet is an essential development tool that helps you quickly create repetitive structures like lists, tables, or ordered elements with minimal typing.

2. Difference between a Library and Framework?
    Frameworks provide a more comprehensive set of functionality and often include a wide variety of pre-built components. 
    
    Libraries tend to be more specialized and provide a specific set of functions or tools.

3. What is CDN? Why do we use it?
    a CDN is a network of servers linked together with the goal of delivering content as quickly, cheaply, reliably, and securely as possible.

    By using CDN script files, you can use React without downloading or installing anything on your local machine.

4. what is CDN links?
    A content delivery network (CDN) is a network of interconnected servers that speeds up webpage loading for data-heavy applications.

5. Why is React known as React?
     It "reacts" quickly to changes without reloading the whole page. It uses the virtual DOM to efficiently update parts of a webpage. It's built around components that "react" and update.

6. What is crossorigin in script tag?
    The crossorigin attribute, valid on the <audio> , <img> , <link> , <script> , and <video> elements, provides support for CORS, defining how the element handles cross-origin requests, thereby enabling the configuration of the CORS requests for the element's fetched data.

7. What is diference between React and ReactDOM
    React provides the tools and concepts to define component-based user interfaces, 
    ReactDOM handles the task of rendering those interfaces in a web environment.

8. What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?
    Development Environment: react.development.js Debugging Support: This file includes extra warnings and error messages to help developers identify and fix issues during development.
    Production Environment: react.production.js Minimised Code: This file is optimised for production use by removing development-specific warnings and tools, resulting in smaller file size.


9. What is async and defer?
    async scripts execute as soon as they are downloaded, which is not necessarily in the order in which they appear in the document. 
    defer, on the other hand, preserves the order and ensures that scripts execute after the document has been parsed.

10.What is `NPM`?
    is a package manager and a software register but it's also a place where developers can find, build and manage code packages

11. What is `Parcel/Webpack`? Why do we need it?
    -Parcel
        - Parcel doesn’t need any of the external configuration files to be specified after its installation to work.
        - For maintaining the appropriate size of the bundle and also maintain the performance of the application the tree shaking also known as dead code elimination is provided in the parcel.
        - No such provision of code splitting is present in the parcel.
        - Hot module replacement functionality provided in built-in case of parcels.
        - Parcel has the problem of live reloading functionality. Parcel has the problems of hooks, middleware, and logging of HTTP though it automatically builds the app depending on the change that occurs.
        - Parcel has the in-built module transformers that help to learn how another type of files than JS can be run and handled.

    -Webpack
        - Webpack on the other hand requires a separate config file that will specify plugins, output and entry loaders, transformations, and other details after the installation process is completed.
        -  There is no such provision of tree shaking or elimination of the dead code in the case of the web pack provided in its in-built services. However, The functionality can be achieved by adding the plugin webpack-dev-server.
        - Webpack has the provision of lazy loading by using code splitting.
        - We need to add an additional plugin of webpack-dev-server for having the HMR functionality that is Hot Module Replacement.
        - Webpack provides the functionality of live reloading with the help of the webpack-dev-server plugin installation.
        - Webpack bundlers require the manual specification of the installation, configuration, types of the files to be transformed, plugin configuration for making them transform

12. What is `.parcel-cache`
    parcel-cache` is a directory generated by the Parcel bundler, a popular tool used for bundling and optimizing web applications. It serves a specific purpose in the build process.

13. What is `npx` ?
    NPX stands for Node Package eXecute. It is simply an NPM package runner. It allows developers to execute any Javascript Package available on the NPM registry without even installing it.

14. What is difference between `dependencies` vs `devDependencies`
    A dependency is a library that a project needs to function effectively. 
    DevDependencies are the packages a developer needs during development.

15. What is Tree Shaking?
    tree-shaking means removing unreachable code (also known as dead code) from a bundle

16. What is Hot Module Replacement?
    Hot Module Replacement (or HMR) is one of the most useful features offered by webpack. It allows all kinds of modules to be updated at runtime without the need for a full refresh. This page focuses on implementation while the concepts page gives more details on how it works and why it's useful.
